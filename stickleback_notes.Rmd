# Overview

General notes about process and steps to test eDNA population genomics approaches.

Working on `snakemake` approach for downloading the stickleback genome, searching for `sbf1` cut sites, identifying flanking regions, and selecting baits from these 120bp regions.

### Stickleback Genome

Has been mapped, see the [NCBI FTP Website here](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/180/675/GCA_000180675.1_ASM18067v1/), and the [GenBank site here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000180675.1/)
